# Halma Board
A GUI developed purely in wxPython.

The GUI is fully functional and can save and load boards. Currently, it is a 2-player game.
An AI module to play against will be added soon, along with some GUI updates

# Setup
Make sure wxPython is installed, then run:
```
$ python main.py
```
This will likely change with future iterations of the game
